Require stack:
- D:\extra\DevDistruct\live-code-editor\node_modules\ajv-keywords\dist\definitions\typeof.js
- D:\extra\DevDistruct\live-code-editor\node_modules\ajv-keywords\dist\keywords\typeof.js
- D:\extra\DevDistruct\live-code-editor\node_modules\ajv-keywords\dist\keywords\index.js
- D:\extra\DevDistruct\live-code-editor\node_modules\ajv-keywords\dist\index.js

- D:\extra\DevDistruct\live-code-editor\node_modules\react-scripts\scripts\start.js
```

**The Problem Explained:**

This error usually indicates an issue with the installed packages in your project's `node_modules` directory. Specifically, it often points to a problem with the dependencies `ajv`, `ajv-keywords`, and `schema-utils`, which are commonly used by `webpack-dev-server` in React development environments. These packages might be corrupted, have mismatched versions, or are simply not installed correctly.

**The Simple Solution:**

The most reliable way to fix this is to completely remove and then reinstall these specific packages. Here's the three-step process:

1.  **Open your Terminal:** Navigate to the root directory of your React project in your terminal or command prompt.

2.  **Uninstall the Problematic Packages:** Run the following command to remove the potentially corrupted packages:

    ```bash
    npm uninstall ajv ajv-keywords schema-utils
    ```

3.  **Reinstall the Packages:** Now, install fresh versions of these packages:

    ```bash
    npm install ajv ajv-keywords schema-utils
    ```

4.  **Restart Your Development Server:** Finally, try starting your React application again:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

**For easy access:**

```bash
npm uninstall ajv ajv-keywords schema-utils
npm install ajv ajv-keywords schema-utils
npm start
```

**Why This Works:**

This process ensures that you have a clean and consistent installation of the `ajv`, `ajv-keywords`, and `schema-utils` packages. By removing the existing (potentially faulty) versions and installing them anew, you eliminate any underlying issues causing the "Cannot find module" error.

**In Most Cases, This Should Get You Up and Running!**

If you continue to experience issues, consider these additional steps:

* **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`):** Sometimes a more thorough cleaning is needed. Delete the entire `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` (if you're using npm) or `yarn.lock` (if you're using Yarn) file. Then, run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall all your project dependencies from scratch.
* **Check Node.js and npm Versions:** Ensure you have compatible versions of Node.js and npm installed. You can check your versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
